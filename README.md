# Form with Redux and Typescript

In this project I worked with redux and typescript. For a while I am learning Typescript, but I haven't worked with redux and Typescript. I wacthed a video which is from
Cory McAboy and It was pretty a instructive video. If you want to learn or improve yourself about it. You watch it.
